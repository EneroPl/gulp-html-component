# HTML Components

When we work with static pages, like landing pages or other small-scale projects, there are often blocks of code that have to be duplicated in an html file or given to JavaScript, creating separate block rendering functions.

I thought that both options have disadvantages: Abundance of duplicate code; extra JavaScript logic, where there is no talk of extensibility and universality. Therefore, I decided to make this utility capable of working both on its own for more comfortable work with display components without having to think about display logic.
